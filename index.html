            <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
            <p>Enthusiastic and driven Automotive Technician with 3 years of experience working on high-performance and specialist vehicles, with a strong foundation in motorsport. My career began as a Junior Technician with a Caterham racing team, where I developed a fast-paced, precision-focused approach to vehicle preparation and trackside support. I further honed my skills through a structured apprenticeship at a Volvo dealership, before progressing to a workshop-based role with an independent Porsche specialist. With hands-on knowledge of performance engineering and a passion for motorsport, I am now looking to return to a race-focused environment where I can contribute to a competitive team and continue developing my motorsport career.</p>
            <p>Willing to relocate: Anywhere</p>
